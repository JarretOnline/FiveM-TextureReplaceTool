Just look in the stream folder of the resource and if you see a *.ytd, *.ydd,*.ydr, *.yft, or *.ypt files, there would be something what you can adjust.
But you can do it for every texture which you want. As long as you find corresponding texture container (file) and stream it.

First we need to download Texture Toolkit. https://de.gta5-mods.com/tools/texture-toolkit

unzip and execute Texture Tool.exe
Now click File > Load and go to the folder of the resource whrere you want to replase texture. And search for following files *.ytd, *.ydd, *.ydr, *.yft or *.ypt. In those files you will find textures which you can replace.

Those files are like containers which includes multiple textures. Choose which you want to replace and click Edit > Export then save the .dds file somewhere.

Open .dds file which you have exported with a graphic editor which you have (e.g. I use GIMP because itâ€™s for free) ðŸ˜‰ but there is other editors there.

Now adjust this texture like you want and let your creative side shine ðŸ˜‰

Alright, now save your work and overwrite .dds file. Name should stay the same.

We are almost done.
Go to Texture Tool and import .dds file in the corresponding texture/image back (Edit > Import).
After that save .ytd (File > Save). Now you need to overwrite those files on you server (in resources folder where your scripts are stored) and restart server.

By the way as you can see, this texture has multiple layers which have different sizes (but overall size/resolution remains the same).
This is needed to have textures for multiple distances (save some hardware usage).
Like if you are far away you donâ€™t need high resolution texture for that, but when you get closer texture will have more details. So you should replace textures in all layers.

In also could be that textures are splitted between different files.
